# COVID-19-CXR  
## Dateset 
COVID-19-CXR Dataset, which contains 6,354 CXRs, divided into train set and test set, both include include COVID19, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA
Thanks to these dataset, the COVID-19-CXR Dateset is combined by these public/open source datasets!

The COVID-19-CXR Dataset is waiting to upload to this github repository, before then you could download from this Goolge Drive link or Tianyi Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15DnLoaZEM3d6WjtLWiiT_3IMFCibdQrJ?usp=sharing

## Model  
The Model is introduced in this paper: “Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks To Diagnose COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images”, but the paper hasn‘t been published, maybe you could search this paper in the feature(Who knows!).
